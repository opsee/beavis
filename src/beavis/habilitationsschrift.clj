  "Handle Results and Responses separately in the same Riemann core.

  When an event is received in this stream stage, we first pull the
  Responses out of the Result and run them through the Riemann stream.
  Once through, we then query the index to retrieve the current state
  of affairs for that (host, service) tuple and replace the responses
  with those contained in the Riemann index. It then passes this
  mutated Result through the stream for further inspection by Riemann.

  The returned, modified Result is then passed on to the next stage
  of stream processing.

  A trivial example:

  If the Index currently contains the following for (host a, service a):
  {:host A, :service A, :state ok}

  And the following \"Result\" is passed into the stream:
  {:target 'group', :responses {:host A, :service A, :state bad}}

  What comes out of the Riemann stream, may look like:
  {:target 'group', :responses {:host A, :service A, :state ok}}

  This may happen in the case that this was considered a service flap
  by Riemann.
